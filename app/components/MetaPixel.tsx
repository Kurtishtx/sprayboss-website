/* Meta Pixel.
 *
 * The point of this is the retargeting audience, and an audience can only ever contain people
 * who visited AFTER the pixel went live — there is no way to add yesterday's visitors. So this
 * wants to be on every site before any ad money is spent, not after.
 *
 * The ID comes from NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID so the same component drops into all ten sites
 * and the value is set once per Vercel project. With no ID set the component renders nothing
 * and costs nothing, which is what happens on a site that has not been configured yet.
 *
 * PRODUCT tags every event with which of the ten it came from, so one pixel can serve the whole
 * suite and still be segmented — "everyone who looked at PoolBossPro" stays a targetable slice.
 *
 * Loaded through next/script rather than a hand-rolled injector, matching how the Google tag in
 * this same layout is loaded. Inline scripts need an id for Next to track them.
