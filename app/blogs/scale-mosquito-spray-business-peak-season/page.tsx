        <h1>How to Scale a Mosquito Spray Business During Peak Season Without Dropping Stops</h1>

        <p>Peak mosquito season — June through August in most markets — is when the business is under maximum operational pressure simultaneously. Customer demand is highest, mosquito populations are at peak, and every customer wants their 21-day treatment completed on or close to schedule. At the same time, heat, equipment maintenance, and technician availability create constraints on how many stops can actually be completed per day. A mosquito spray business at 200 accounts during peak season has 40 to 45 accounts due every 21 days — roughly 2 full route days of treatment every week, continuously. Managing this volume without software that shows exactly which accounts are due, which are overdue, and which are assigned to which route day is how accounts get dropped and customers cancel.</p>

        <h2>The Waiting List as the Overdue Alert System</h2>
        <p>In <a href="/mosquito-spray-software">mosquito spray software</a>, the waiting list is both the scheduling tool and the overdue detection system. Properties whose 21-day interval has elapsed appear on the waiting list sorted by due date. Properties that have been waiting 25 days appear before those due today. When a dispatcher opens the waiting list during peak season and sees 12 accounts that are 3 to 5 days past their scheduled interval, that&apos;s a routing prioritization signal — those 12 accounts get the next available route day, not accounts due tomorrow. The waiting list automatically surfaces overdue accounts without manual tracking.</p>

        <h2>Multiple Crews, One Waiting List</h2>
        <p>Adding a second technician during peak season doesn&apos;t create a separate routing problem if the software manages both crews from the same waiting list. The dispatcher builds two concurrent route days from the same pool of due accounts — Crew A gets the east zone, Crew B gets the west zone — using the same circle map selection tool. Both routes draw from the same waiting list; when an account is added to Crew A&apos;s route, it&apos;s no longer available for Crew B&apos;s selection. Conflict is prevented at the route-building step rather than discovered when two technicians show up at the same property.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Service Alerts at Scale</h2>
        <p>The pre-service SMS that fires when a route is dispatched fires to every customer on both routes simultaneously. A dispatcher dispatching 14 accounts across 2 crews triggers 14 individual customer alerts in one action — each alert going to the correct property owner with the personalized message format configured in the alert settings. During peak season, when dispatch is happening 4 to 5 days per week, this automation keeps the pre-service communication current without any manual texting effort from the office.</p>

        <h2>Throughput Visibility: Knowing When to Add Capacity</h2>
        <p>The waiting list total — sq ft waiting, accounts due, accounts overdue — is the throughput metric for a mosquito spray business. When the total waiting consistently runs 3 or more days ahead of the current dispatch capacity, the business is operating at the limit of current crew capacity. When the waiting list clears to 0 or 1 day ahead, capacity matches demand. Watching this metric through peak season gives the business owner a clear signal for when temporary capacity (part-time technician, rental equipment for a crew) is actually needed vs. when normal scheduling variation will resolve itself.</p>
