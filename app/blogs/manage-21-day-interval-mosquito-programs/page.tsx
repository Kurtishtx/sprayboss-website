        <h1>How to Manage 21-Day Interval Mosquito Programs Without Manually Rebooking Every Visit</h1>

        <p>The 21-day interval is the operational backbone of the mosquito spray model. Every 21 days — from the completion date of the last treatment, not from the start of the program — each customer is due again. For a company with 200 customers running 6 treatments per season, the interval cycle generates 1,200 treatment events that each need to be scheduled, dispatched, completed, and rescheduled for the next cycle. In a system without automatic interval scheduling, each completion creates an immediate task: open the calendar, find the 21-day window, create the next appointment. Multiply that by every completion across a full season and manual rebooking becomes its own part-time job. <a href="/mosquito-spray-software">Mosquito spray software</a> replaces the rebooking workflow with automatic interval calculation — each completion creates the next due date with no action required.</p>

        <h2>How Auto-Interval Works</h2>
        <p>When a technician logs a completion for a mosquito spray stop, the system records the completion date and calculates the next treatment due date by adding the configured interval (21 days by default) to the completion date. The account then appears in the waiting list 21 days later, pre-populated with the property, service type, measurement, and pricing. No appointment creation, no calendar entry, no rebooking confirmation — the completion event is the scheduling event for the next visit. The system handles the math and the record-keeping; the dispatcher&apos;s only action is building the route when the account appears in the waiting list.</p>

        <h2>Interval Flexibility: When 21 Days Isn&apos;t the Rule</h2>
        <p>Some properties or program types run at different intervals: 14 days for natural/essential oil products with shorter residuals, 28 days for fall season when mosquito pressure is reduced, or a custom interval for a specific customer&apos;s contract terms. Software with configurable interval per service program supports any schedule the business sells — without requiring manual adjustment to each account&apos;s individual calendar appointments. The interval is set at the program level and applied automatically at every completion cycle. Changing a customer from a 21-day to a 28-day program is a program reconfiguration, not a manual edit to every future appointment.</p>

        <h2>What &quot;Due Date&quot; Actually Means on the Waiting List</h2>
        <p>The waiting list sorts accounts by treatment due date, which is the completion date plus the configured interval. A customer whose last treatment was June 1st on a 21-day program shows as due June 22nd. If that customer isn&apos;t serviced on June 22nd due to weather or scheduling, they appear as overdue on June 23rd, June 24th, and beyond — still sorted correctly relative to other overdue accounts, and still visible to the dispatcher without any manual intervention. The waiting list handles schedule slippage automatically; overdue accounts don&apos;t fall off the list or require re-entry — they stay visible and sorted until they&apos;re completed.</p>

        <h2>Treatments Remaining and Program Completion</h2>
        <p>For package programs with a fixed number of treatments (e.g., a 6-treatment season package), the system tracks treatments remaining per customer. When the 6th treatment is completed, the account is flagged as having fulfilled the package — no further treatments are auto-scheduled unless a new program is activated for the following season. Treatments-remaining tracking gives the dispatcher visibility into which customers are approaching the end of their current package and need a renewal conversation before the season closes.</p>
