        <h1>How to Handle Overdue Mosquito Control Treatments During Peak Season</h1>

        <p>In mosquito control, overdue means unprotected. A customer who is 5 days past their 21-day treatment interval has been without barrier spray residual for 5 days. During June or July, that&apos;s 5 days when mosquito pressure is at its annual peak and the yard is accumulating new mosquito activity that the missing treatment would have prevented. Overdue accounts are a protection gap issue, not just an administrative one — and they require more urgency than overdue accounts in services where the consequence of a missed visit is less immediate.</p>

        <h2>Identifying Overdue Accounts Before They Become Customer Complaints</h2>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/mosquito-control-software">mosquito control software</a>, overdue accounts are surfaced automatically in the waiting list with a days-overdue indicator. An account 3 days past its due date shows as &quot;Overdue — 3 days.&quot; An account 7 days past shows as &quot;Overdue — 7 days.&quot; Sorting the waiting list by days-overdue identifies the most behind accounts immediately — before any customers have called, before the protection gap has been noticed, and while there&apos;s still time to recover the treatment without a customer complaint. This proactive visibility is what allows a well-managed mosquito company to resolve overdue accounts before they generate service failure calls rather than in response to them.</p>

        <h2>The Map View for Overdue Routing Priority</h2>
        <p>On the waiting list map view, overdue accounts appear as high-priority pins — visually distinct from accounts just reaching their due date. When building a route for a geographic zone during peak season, the dispatcher selects overdue accounts first within the circle before adding accounts that are just becoming due. This ensures the most behind customers are treated first each day, minimizing the total protection gap across the customer base. An account that was 5 days overdue yesterday should be on today&apos;s route — not tomorrow&apos;s, not &quot;when we get to that area.&quot;</p>

        <h2>Inserting Overdue Accounts Into In-Progress Routes</h2>
        <p>When a weather delay creates a backlog of overdue accounts, some of those accounts may be in the geographic zone already being serviced by a technician mid-route. Rather than waiting for a dedicated overdue catch-up day, the dispatcher can insert overdue accounts from the current zone into the technician&apos;s active route. The updated route appears on the technician&apos;s mobile device immediately — the new stop is inserted in the optimal sequence position without requiring a call to the technician. The technician sees the new stop, navigates to it, and the account is resolved on the same day it became urgent.</p>

        <h2>Proactive Customer Communication for Overdue Accounts</h2>
        <p>A mosquito customer who is 5 or more days past their treatment window and hasn&apos;t heard from the company is a significant cancellation risk. A proactive text — &quot;Hi [Name], we haven&apos;t forgotten you — your next mosquito treatment is coming up very soon. We&apos;re routing your area now and will confirm your appointment date shortly. Thank you for your patience.&quot; — bridges the gap and prevents the &quot;I&apos;m going to cancel because no one is coming&quot; call that overdue accounts frequently generate. This message takes under 30 seconds to send from the customer record in the software and can prevent a cancellation that would take a 10-minute phone conversation to reverse — if it&apos;s even reversible at that point.</p>

        <h2>Post-Delay Recovery: Getting Back on Interval</h2>
        <p>After a weather delay creates a cluster of overdue accounts, the goal is to complete all of them within 3 to 5 days and get back on interval for the following cycle. The first post-delay day should be structured as an overdue-priority route — all available technician time directed at the most behind accounts first. Once the overdue list is clear, the regular waiting list rhythm resumes. A recovery that takes 7 to 10 days rather than 3 to 5 days creates a second ripple of overdue accounts because the follow-up visits (scheduled 21 days from the original treatment) are now 7 to 10 days behind before the cycle even starts.</p>
