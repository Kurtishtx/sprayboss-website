        <h1>How to Know Which Mosquito Spray Customers Are Overdue During Peak Season</h1>

        <p>At peak season in a 200-account mosquito spray operation, accounts fall behind their 21-day interval for predictable reasons: a rainy week when applications aren&apos;t possible, a technician absence that cuts route capacity, back-to-back holiday weekends that compress the schedule. When this happens, the business is running with some accounts 24, 26, or 28 days past their last treatment while still servicing new due accounts on schedule. In a manual system — a calendar with individual appointments — identifying which accounts are specifically overdue requires scanning through past-due appointments one by one. In <a href="/mosquito-spray-software">mosquito spray software</a>, the waiting list is the overdue detection system by design: every account that has passed its interval is visible, sorted by how far past due it is, before the dispatcher builds the first route of the day.</p>

        <h2>How the Waiting List Surfaces Overdue Accounts</h2>
        <p>The waiting list sorts all due and overdue accounts by treatment due date — with the longest-overdue at the top. A property whose last treatment was June 1st on a 21-day interval has a due date of June 22nd. On June 25th, that property shows on the waiting list as 3 days overdue. On June 28th, it shows as 6 days overdue. The dispatcher opens the waiting list and the overdue accounts are at the top of the list — no filter, no report, no manual cross-referencing. The sort order is the alert system.</p>

        <h2>Overdue Communication: Should You Tell Customers?</h2>
        <p>Some mosquito spray operators send a proactive message to customers whose treatment is more than 5 days overdue: &quot;We apologize for the delay in your scheduled mosquito treatment — we&apos;re currently scheduling your next visit and will confirm shortly.&quot; This message, sent manually from the Texts screen using the customer&apos;s number, addresses customer anxiety before they call to ask where their service is. Customers who wait 10 days past their expected treatment without communication are significantly more likely to question the value of the program and cancel. Proactive overdue communication is a retention tool disguised as a logistics message.</p>

        <h2>Prioritizing Overdue Accounts in Route Building</h2>
        <p>When building routes during recovery from a scheduling backlog, the dispatcher has a choice: service accounts in pure geographic efficiency (minimize drive time) or prioritize the most overdue accounts regardless of geography. Most effective practice is a blend: identify the top 10 most overdue accounts, build a route that covers those accounts first, then fill remaining capacity with geographically efficient additions from the broader due list. The circle map tool supports this by letting the dispatcher manually select specific overdue properties before drawing a circle to fill in the surrounding geography.</p>

        <h2>Preventing Overdue Accumulation With Consistent Scheduling</h2>
        <p>The most effective overdue prevention strategy is blocking route days proactively in advance of known disruptions. A company that knows Friday is a holiday builds Thursday and Saturday routes the week before to maintain the 21-day cadence without Friday capacity. Software that shows the full waiting list 7 to 14 days ahead — accounts that will be due in the next two weeks — lets the dispatcher plan around schedule gaps before they become overdue accumulation problems.</p>
