        <h1>How Pest Control Software Manages Commercial vs. Residential Accounts</h1>

        <p>Commercial and residential pest control accounts operate differently in almost every dimension — billing, service frequency, access requirements, compliance documentation, and customer communication expectations are all materially different between a quarterly residential account and a monthly restaurant contract. Pest control software that handles both account types well needs a flexible enough data model to accommodate these differences without requiring two separate operational systems. The best approach is not to build a &quot;commercial mode&quot; and a &quot;residential mode&quot; but to build flexible account, property, and billing structures that accommodate the operational realities of each without friction.</p>

        <h2>Billing Differences: Residential vs. Commercial</h2>
        <p>Residential customers typically pay by card on file, by individual invoice, or by annual prepay. Commercial accounts typically bill on net-30 or net-60 terms to a business accounts payable department — which means invoiced billing, purchase order requirements on some accounts, and payment that arrives 30 to 60 days after service rather than immediately. Purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-software">pest control software</a> supports both: card-on-file for residential, invoiced billing with configurable due dates for commercial. The same platform handles both billing models without requiring separate invoicing systems for each account type.</p>

        <h2>Service Frequency: Monthly Commercial vs. Quarterly Residential</h2>
        <p>Most residential pest control accounts run on quarterly or bi-monthly programs. Commercial accounts — restaurants, food service facilities, multi-unit housing, healthcare — often require monthly or even bi-weekly service due to regulatory requirements and higher pest pressure. Monthly commercial accounts appear 12 times per year in the waiting list, vs. 4 times for quarterly residential. The routing difference is significant: a 12-stop route of monthly commercial accounts can include the same property appearing every month, while a residential route changes composition every 90 days. Software that handles both program frequencies from the same waiting list and routing interface doesn&apos;t require the dispatcher to manage two different scheduling systems.</p>

        <h2>Access and Scheduling Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Commercial accounts often have access windows — a restaurant can only be serviced before 8 AM or after 10 PM, a school can only be treated when students are not present, an office building requires 24-hour advance notice for building management. These access constraints are stored in the property notes for each commercial account and dispatch with every route so the technician sees them before arriving. Scheduling a commercial account outside its access window is prevented by the dispatcher who can see the access notes on the property record before scheduling.</p>

        <h2>Documentation Requirements for Commercial Accounts</h2>
        <p>Some commercial accounts — particularly food service facilities — require signed service reports, pest sighting logs, or bait station inspection records in addition to standard application logs. Documents can be attached to property records, stored and accessible from the compliance report, and produced for the customer or their regulator on request. The chemical compliance report filters to show only applications at a specific commercial address, producing a complete service history document for facilities that require annual compliance summaries from their pest control provider.</p>
