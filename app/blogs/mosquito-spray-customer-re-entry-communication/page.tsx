        <h1>How to Handle Customer Re-Entry After Mosquito Barrier Spray — The Right Way</h1>

        <p>Barrier spray products have a restricted re-entry interval (REI) — the period between application and when it&apos;s safe for people and pets to return to treated outdoor areas while the product is drying. For the bifenthrin-based products most commonly used in residential barrier spray, the REI is typically 30 minutes to 2 hours. For essential oil blends, it may be shorter. The REI isn&apos;t optional guidance — it&apos;s a label requirement, and communicating it to customers is the applicator&apos;s responsibility under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). How that communication happens — and when — determines both compliance risk and customer trust. <a href="/mosquito-spray-software">Mosquito spray software</a> automates the re-entry message to fire at the exact moment of treatment completion.</p>

        <h2>The Timing Problem With Manual Re-Entry Communication</h2>
        <p>A technician who completes a barrier spray at 10:47 AM and then drives to the next stop is not in a position to text the customer about re-entry at that moment. If the office is responsible for the post-service message, it depends on the technician reporting the completion before the office can send the message — introducing a 15 to 45 minute delay between completion and customer notification. If the customer has already re-entered the yard with their children or pets before the message arrives, the communication has failed at its most critical function. Automated post-service SMS triggered by the field completion log fires the re-entry message within seconds of the technician submitting the completion form — before the next stop has begun.</p>

        <h2>What the Re-Entry Message Should Say</h2>
        <p>The re-entry interval message for mosquito barrier spray should include: confirmation that the treatment was completed, the specific re-entry interval for the product applied (&quot;Please keep people and pets away from treated areas for [X time] while the product dries&quot;), and a brief note about what to expect (light product smell that dissipates after the drying period). The message should be specific to the mosquito service type — not a generic &quot;service complete&quot; confirmation that could apply to any service. In mosquito spray software, alert types are configurable per service category: the mosquito completion alert is set up once with the appropriate re-entry content and fires automatically at every mosquito treatment completion, independently from lawn care or general pest control completion alerts.</p>

        <h2>Pets and Children: The Most Common Concern</h2>
        <p>The most common customer concern after barrier spray is pet safety. A proactive re-entry message that specifically mentions keeping pets off treated surfaces until dry reduces post-service calls dramatically. Customers who receive a clear &quot;keep pets indoors for 30 minutes&quot; message at the moment of completion don&apos;t need to call and ask — the information is already in their hands. Companies that communicate re-entry proactively report significantly lower after-service call volume compared to companies that rely on customers to read the re-entry interval on their estimate documentation or assume they remember from a conversation at sign-up.</p>

        <h2>Two-Way SMS as the Re-Entry Follow-Up Channel</h2>
        <p>When a customer has a question about re-entry — &quot;My dog was outside during the spray, should I be worried?&quot; — a two-way SMS system lets them reply directly to the completion message and receive an answer. The reply appears in the office&apos;s Texts screen and can be answered by whoever is available. This closes the loop in the customer&apos;s preferred communication channel (text) rather than requiring them to call a number during business hours.</p>
