        <h1>How to Manage Broadleaf Weed Control Programs Alongside Fertilizer Rounds</h1>

        <p>Most lawn care customers who enroll in a fertilizer program also need weed control — and most who need broadleaf weed control benefit from fertilizer. In practice, many visits to the same property include both: a fertilizer application for the turf and a broadleaf herbicide application for the weeds. Managing both programs for the same customer without mixing their schedules, compliance records, or SMS communications requires a multi-program account structure that keeps each service type tracked independently under a shared customer profile.</p>

        <h2>The Multi-Program Account Structure</h2>
        <p>A customer with both a 6-round fertilizer program and a 4-visit broadleaf weed control program has two active service sequences under their account. The fertilizer program runs on its interval — say, every 8 weeks. The broadleaf program runs on its own interval — say, every 6 weeks. These intervals don&apos;t align perfectly, which means most visits are single-program visits, but occasionally both are due on the same day and the technician handles both at one stop.</p>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/weed-control-software">weed control software</a>, each program type maintains its own round tracking, its own due date, and its own compliance log. When both are due simultaneously, both appear on the technician&apos;s stop card for that property. The tech logs each service separately. Two compliance records are produced for that stop — one for fertilizer, one for broadleaf. Round numbering for each program tracks independently.</p>

        <h2>Why Round Numbering Must Stay Separate</h2>
        <p>A customer who receives a broadleaf application and a fertilizer application at the same stop hasn&apos;t received &quot;Round 4&quot; of a combined program — they&apos;ve received Round 3 of fertilizer and Round 2 of broadleaf simultaneously. If both are logged under a shared round counter, the round numbers for both programs are wrong within the first combination visit. By mid-season, neither program&apos;s round history is accurate.</p>
        <p>Separate round tracking ensures that when you look at a customer&apos;s service history in October, you can see clearly: fertilizer round 6 of 6 complete, broadleaf weed control round 4 of 4 complete. That record supports renewal conversations, price adjustments, and compliance documentation without reconstruction from fragmented logs.</p>

        <h2>Compliance Log Separation for Mixed-Service Stops</h2>
        <p>A fertilizer compliance log captures product (fertilizer product name), application form (granular or liquid), rate, and area treated. A broadleaf weed control compliance log captures product (herbicide name and EPA reg number), liquid rate per 1,000 sq ft, active ingredient, weather conditions, re-entry interval, and applicator license. These are structurally different log types that serve different regulatory purposes. Forcing them into a single log entry to simplify data entry produces records that are incomplete for one or both programs.</p>
        <p>At a combination stop, the field logging form should prompt the technician to log each service type separately — a fertilizer log and a broadleaf log — even though they&apos;re at the same property at the same time. The submission completes both records simultaneously so the technician isn&apos;t making two separate stops from a workflow standpoint, but the records are properly separated.</p>

        <h2>SMS Coordination for Multi-Service Stops</h2>
        <p>When two services are completed at the same stop, the post-service SMS should cover both — re-entry interval for the broadleaf product, watering instructions for the fertilizer, and the next scheduled dates for each program. A single combined SMS that addresses both is less confusing than two separate messages. Configuring the combined-visit SMS template as a distinct template type — triggered when both a fertilizer and a weed control log are submitted at the same stop — handles this cleanly.</p>
