        <h1>How Pest Control Software Logs Interior and Exterior Treatments as Separate Records</h1>

        <p>A full-service pest control visit typically includes both interior and exterior treatments — perimeter spray on the foundation and entry points outside, crack-and-crevice treatment or bait placement inside. In many cases, different products are applied inside vs. outside: a residual insecticide on the exterior perimeter, a less-toxic bait or gel inside where food contact is a concern, or a different active ingredient for interior use due to label restrictions. State pesticide records must accurately reflect what product was applied in what area. A single log entry that lists both interior and exterior treatment with a single product is technically inaccurate if different products were used in different areas — which is a compliance exposure in an inspection.</p>

        <h2>Treatment Area Checkboxes</h2>
        <p>The compliance log form in purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-software">pest control software</a> includes treatment area checkboxes that the technician selects at the time of completion: Interior, Exterior, Perimeter, Attic, Crawl Space, Garage, Kitchen, Bathrooms, Baseboards, Entry Points, Plumbing Penetrations, and others as configured by the company. These checkboxes capture exactly where the treatment was applied on each visit and appear in the compliance record for that service event. When a technician treats only the exterior during a routine quarterly visit but also treats the interior at customer request, both treatment areas are captured in the same log entry with the products applied to each.</p>

        <h2>Handling Different Products for Interior vs. Exterior</h2>
        <p>When the interior and exterior treatments use different products, the compliance log needs to capture both. In software with a product mix structure, the technician can log multiple products on a single service stop — exterior product A applied to perimeter, interior product B applied to kitchen and bathrooms. Each product pre-fills its EPA reg number and active ingredient from the product library, and each is recorded as a separate product entry within the same service log. The result is a single visit with a complete, accurate record of every product applied, in every area, at the configured rates.</p>

        <h2>Customers Who Decline Interior Service</h2>
        <p>Some customers on regular exterior-only programs occasionally request interior service, and some customers on combined programs sometimes decline interior service on a specific visit due to scheduling or household circumstances. The treatment area checkboxes capture which areas were actually treated on each visit — so the compliance record accurately reflects what happened, not what was planned. A customer who declined interior service on their Q2 visit has an exterior-only record for Q2 and a complete interior/exterior record for Q3, which is exactly what the records should show.</p>

        <h2>Interior Treatment Frequency as a Business Metric</h2>
        <p>Filtering the compliance report by treatment area — showing only visits that included an interior treatment — reveals how often interior service is actually requested and completed across the customer base. For companies offering combined plans but finding that interior service is rarely utilized, this data informs whether the interior component of the plan is adding perceived value or mostly going unused. It&apos;s also useful for identifying properties where interior treatment frequency suggests an active infestation that has not resolved — a signal for a re-service call or a program adjustment conversation.</p>
