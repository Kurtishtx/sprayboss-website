        <h1>How to Manage Multiple Service Types From One Spray Business Platform</h1>

        <p>A spray business that offers fertilizer programs, weed control rounds, pest control recurring services, and mosquito add-ons is running four distinct scheduling cadences simultaneously — each with different program intervals, different product and compliance requirements, and different SMS templates. Managing all four from separate tools, separate spreadsheets, or a generic scheduling platform that treats all services the same creates a coordination overhead that grows faster than the account base. A single platform that handles all four service types as first-class programs — with independent scheduling intervals, service-type-specific compliance logs, and separate SMS configurations — is what makes multi-service operation viable at scale.</p>

        <h2>The Waiting List as Multi-Service Command Center</h2>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/spray-business-software">spray business software</a>, the waiting list shows all due accounts across all service types in a single view. A dispatcher looking at Monday morning sees fertilizer Round 3 accounts due in the north zone, weed control post-emergent accounts due in the east zone, and monthly pest control accounts due across multiple areas — all in the same waiting list, each clearly labeled by service type. Filters let the dispatcher isolate any single service type for a specialized route or see the full cross-service demand for mixed routing. No toggling between separate systems to understand the full scope of the day&apos;s production.</p>

        <h2>Independent Program Intervals Per Service Type</h2>
        <p>Fertilizer rounds might be on a 6-round annual program (roughly every 6 to 8 weeks during the season). Weed control post-emergent might be on a 4-week follow-up cycle. Pest control quarterly is every 90 days. Monthly mosquito is every 30 days during the active season. Each of these intervals runs independently per customer account. A customer enrolled in fertilizer and pest control has two separate scheduling cycles on their account, each auto-scheduling from its own completion date at its own interval. These don&apos;t interfere with each other — a completed fertilizer Round 3 auto-schedules Round 4; the pest control quarterly auto-schedules from its own completion date independently.</p>

        <h2>Service-Type-Specific Compliance Logs</h2>
        <p>A fertilizer application log and a pest control application log require different fields. Fertilizer logs need round number, product type (granular or liquid), application rate per sq ft, N-P-K analysis, and weather conditions. Pest control logs need target pest, treatment areas (interior/exterior), EPA reg number with active ingredient, re-entry interval, and applicator license number. Weed control logs need pre-emergent vs. post-emergent designation, product, EPA reg number, rate, and conditions. Configuring each service type with its own compliance log template ensures the right fields are captured for each service without cluttering logs with irrelevant fields or missing required ones.</p>

        <h2>Service-Type-Specific SMS Templates</h2>
        <p>A customer receiving a fertilizer service reminder should know it&apos;s their Round 3 fertilizer service. A customer receiving a weed control pre-emergent notification should know what they&apos;re getting and the re-entry interval for the specific product. A pest control service confirmation should reference the treatment type and REI. Generic &quot;your service is scheduled&quot; messages that don&apos;t specify service type generate more confusion and cancellation than messages that tell the customer exactly what to expect. Per-service-type SMS templates configured in the platform fire the right message for each service automatically — no manual selection at dispatch time.</p>

        <h2>Revenue Tracking Across Service Types</h2>
        <p>Seeing total daily revenue isn&apos;t enough for a multi-service spray business. Knowing that fertilizer rounds generated $2,100 this week, weed control generated $860, and pest control generated $1,200 tells you which programs are the revenue drivers and which are underperforming relative to account count. This breakdown is only possible if the software tracks service type as a revenue dimension — not just a label on a job record. For operational and growth decisions, service-type revenue breakdown is as important as total revenue.</p>
