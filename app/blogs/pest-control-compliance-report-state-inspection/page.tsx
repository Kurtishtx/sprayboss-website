        <h1>How to Pull a Pest Control Compliance Report for a State Inspection in Under 30 Seconds</h1>

        <p>State pesticide inspectors can arrive unannounced. The request is always some version of: &quot;I need to see your application records for the last 12 months.&quot; What happens next depends entirely on how those records are stored. In a paper-based operation, the response is 45 minutes of searching through binders, folders, or filing cabinets for records that may or may not all be in the same location. In a spreadsheet operation, the response is exporting and filtering a sheet that may or may not have complete data. In purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-software">pest control software</a>, the response is: open the chemical tracking report, enter the date range, click Generate, and print. The entire process takes under 30 seconds.</p>

        <h2>What the Report Contains</h2>
        <p>The chemical compliance report in pest control software produces a structured record of every pesticide application in the selected date range. Each record contains the fields state regulators require:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service date and time</strong> — Timestamped from the field log submission</li>
          <li><strong>Customer name and service address</strong> — From the dispatched property record</li>
          <li><strong>Product name and EPA registration number</strong> — Pre-filled from the product library when the tech selected the product</li>
          <li><strong>Active ingredient(s)</strong> — From the product library record</li>
          <li><strong>Application rate as applied</strong> — Confirmed by the technician in the field</li>
          <li><strong>Area treated</strong> — Sq ft or linear ft from the property record</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment areas</strong> — Interior, exterior, perimeter, attic, crawl space, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Target pest</strong> — Selected by the technician at completion</li>
          <li><strong>Re-entry interval</strong> — From the product record for the applied product</li>
          <li><strong>Weather conditions</strong> — Entered by the technician at the property</li>
          <li><strong>Technician name and license number</strong> — From the logged-in user&apos;s profile</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Filter Options That Speed Inspector Response</h2>
        <p>State inspectors often request records filtered to a specific scope — all applications at a specific address, all applications of a specific product, or all work performed by a specific technician. The compliance report in pest control software filters by all of these dimensions simultaneously. An inspector asking for &quot;all applications of [product] performed by your licensed technicians in the last 24 months&quot; produces the filtered result in a single query. An inspector asking for all records at a specific property address produces those records in under 60 seconds from any device connected to the account.</p>

        <h2>Preset Date Ranges</h2>
        <p>The report interface includes preset date range buttons — Last 30 Days, Last 90 Days, This Year, Last Year — for the most common reporting periods. Generating a full-year compliance summary for an annual inspection review is a one-click action rather than a manual date entry exercise. The report is printable directly from the screen, producing a formatted document that presents identically to a structured compliance report.</p>

        <h2>Product-Level Summary</h2>
        <p>Beyond the detailed application records, the compliance report produces a product-level summary showing total applications per product, total area treated per product, and the date range of use. This summary is useful for state reports that require aggregate product usage data rather than individual application records — and it&apos;s generated from the same database as the detailed records, so the numbers are always consistent between the two views.</p>
