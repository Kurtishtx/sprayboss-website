        <h1>How to Add Mosquito Treatments as an Add-On for Existing Pest Control Customers</h1>

        <p>Mosquito control is one of the highest-margin add-on services a pest control company can offer to its existing customer base. Customers already trust you, already have an active account, and have already demonstrated willingness to pay for recurring pest control. Converting even 15 to 20 percent of a quarterly account base to add a monthly mosquito treatment during the season produces a significant revenue increase with no new customer acquisition cost. The scheduling challenge is managing mosquito add-ons — typically monthly from April through October — alongside the customer&apos;s existing quarterly or bi-monthly program without those two schedules interfering with each other.</p>

        <h2>Mosquito Treatment as a Separate Program, Same Customer</h2>
        <p>A quarterly pest control customer who adds mosquito service now has two separate programs on the same account: a quarterly exterior perimeter treatment (4x/year) and a monthly mosquito backyard treatment (7x/year, April through October). These programs need to be tracked and scheduled independently. The quarterly service due date has nothing to do with the mosquito treatment schedule, and the mosquito treatment schedule has nothing to do with the quarterly service due date. Both should appear on the waiting list at the right time, auto-schedule after each completion, and fire separate SMS confirmations for each service type.</p>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-scheduling-software">pest control scheduling software</a>, a customer account supports multiple simultaneous programs with independent scheduling intervals. The quarterly program schedules itself every 90 days from completion; the mosquito program schedules itself every 30 days from completion during the active season. Both surface in the waiting list when due without any crossover confusion in the scheduling logic.</p>

        <h2>Seasonal Program Start and End Dates</h2>
        <p>Mosquito programs are seasonal — they start in spring and end in fall. When the last mosquito treatment of the season is completed in October, the program should not auto-schedule a November treatment. The scheduling system needs to support a defined active season for seasonal add-on programs, where auto-scheduling resumes the following spring when the season reopens rather than continuing through the winter gap. This is operationally different from a year-round quarterly program where auto-scheduling never pauses.</p>

        <h2>Combined Visit Efficiency</h2>
        <p>When a quarterly perimeter treatment and a monthly mosquito treatment happen to fall on the same date (or within a few days of each other), scheduling them as a combined visit for the same technician is the most efficient option — one drive, two services, one visit confirmation to the customer. The scheduling system should make it easy to see when two programs for the same customer are nearly coincident and offer the option to combine them into a single dispatched stop with separate compliance log entries for each service.</p>

        <h2>Separate Pricing, Separate Revenue Tracking</h2>
        <p>A quarterly customer who adds mosquito service has two separate revenue streams on their account. Tracking these separately — quarterly pest control revenue and seasonal mosquito add-on revenue — gives accurate program-level financial reporting. When evaluating whether the mosquito add-on program is financially worth the product and labor cost, you need the revenue isolated to that program, not combined with general pest control revenue. Most spreadsheet-based tracking systems collapse these into a single account total, making program-level evaluation impossible without manual calculation.</p>

        <h2>SMS for Add-On Service Confirmations</h2>
        <p>Mosquito customers who are also general pest control customers should receive separate confirmations for each service type. A mosquito treatment confirmation that says &quot;Your monthly mosquito treatment is scheduled for [Date]. Please plan to be away from the treated yard areas for 30 minutes after application.&quot; is distinct from the general pest control SMS and tells the customer exactly what service is coming and what to expect. Conflating the two into a single &quot;pest control service&quot; message is less professional and more confusing.</p>
