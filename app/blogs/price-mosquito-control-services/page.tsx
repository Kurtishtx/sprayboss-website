        <h1>How to Price Mosquito Control Services by Linear Foot or Square Foot</h1>

        <p>Mosquito barrier spray pricing varies by company and market but almost always reflects the size of the property being treated — because the amount of product and the time required to treat scale directly with property size. A flat-rate pricing model ($99 per treatment regardless of property size) underprices large properties and overprices small ones, creating margin problems at both ends. Per-sq-ft or per-linear-ft pricing ties the service cost to the actual service volume and produces consistent margins across different property sizes in your customer base.</p>

        <h2>Per-Linear-Foot Pricing for Perimeter Barrier Spray</h2>
        <p>When mosquito barrier spray is applied primarily to the vegetation along a property&apos;s perimeter — trees, shrubs, fence lines, and garden beds — the most accurate pricing unit is linear footage of treatable perimeter. A property with 200 linear feet of vegetation perimeter requires roughly twice the product and time as a property with 100 linear feet, regardless of what the total lot square footage might be. Per-linear-ft pricing for perimeter-focused barrier spray typically runs $0.10 to $0.25 per linear foot per treatment in most markets — a 150-linear-foot property prices at $15 to $37.50 per treatment, consistent with typical mosquito program per-visit pricing when multiplied to seasonal totals.</p>

        <h2>Per-Sq-Ft Pricing for Full-Property Treatment</h2>
        <p>For programs that treat the full property — turf, landscape beds, ornamentals, and wooded areas — per-sq-ft of total treatable area is the appropriate pricing unit. Typical per-sq-ft rates for mosquito barrier spray run $0.005 to $0.012 per sq ft per treatment. A 10,000-sq-ft property at $0.008/sq ft is $80 per treatment — $480 for a 6-treatment seasonal program, in line with market pricing for residential mosquito programs in most regions.</p>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/mosquito-control-software">mosquito control software</a>, the property sq ft and/or linear footage is stored on the customer account. Route revenue calculations in the waiting list use this stored measurement and the configured per-sq-ft or per-linear-ft rate to show expected revenue for any selected group of accounts — before routes are built, before technicians are dispatched, before a single treatment is made.</p>

        <h2>Seasonal Package Pricing</h2>
        <p>Many mosquito control customers prefer a seasonal package price — one number for the full season — over per-visit billing. Seasonal packages provide revenue predictability for the company and payment simplicity for the customer. A 6-treatment seasonal package at $480 is the same total as 6 treatments at $80 each, but the customer sees one price and the company gets full seasonal revenue up front or in installments at defined payment points. Seasonal packages also reduce mid-season cancellations because the customer has already paid (or committed to pay) for the season — the psychological barrier to canceling is higher when there&apos;s a prepaid service at stake.</p>

        <h2>Tiered Pricing for Property Size</h2>
        <p>Rather than a continuous per-sq-ft rate, some mosquito companies use tiered pricing: small lots under 5,000 sq ft at $65/treatment, medium lots 5,000 to 10,000 sq ft at $85/treatment, large lots 10,000 to 20,000 sq ft at $110/treatment, and custom quotes for estates above 20,000 sq ft. Tiered pricing is simpler to communicate than per-sq-ft rates and reduces customer confusion during the estimate conversation. The tiers should reflect actual product and time cost breakpoints — the gap between small and medium tiers should reflect the meaningful increase in product volume and application time, not arbitrary price steps.</p>
