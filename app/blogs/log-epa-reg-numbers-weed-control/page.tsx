        <h1>How to Log EPA Reg Numbers for Weed Control Products in the Field</h1>

        <p>EPA registration numbers are required in every pesticide application record for licensed weed control operators. The EPA reg number identifies the specific registered pesticide product — it&apos;s the link between your compliance record and the federal registration that authorizes you to apply that product. Getting this data into your compliance log accurately, at the time of application, at every property, without relying on a technician&apos;s memory or manual entry, is the core challenge of compliant field logging.</p>

        <h2>What an EPA Registration Number Is and Why It Must Be Logged</h2>
        <p>Every pesticide product sold in the United States is registered with the EPA and assigned a registration number in the format Registrant Number-Product Number (e.g., 62719-556). This number appears on the product label and is the unique identifier for that specific formulation, concentration, and intended use. State pesticide regulations require that this number appear in every application record because it&apos;s the only unambiguous way to determine what was applied, at what specification, under what registered use conditions.</p>
        <p>Without the EPA reg number, your compliance record can&apos;t be verified against the federal registration. A state inspector who asks to see records of applications of a specific herbicide active ingredient will search your logs by EPA reg number. If your logs don&apos;t include it, you have no way to confirm compliance with label requirements, and the inspector may treat the records as non-compliant.</p>

        <h2>The Problem With Manual EPA Reg Number Entry</h2>
        <p>Asking technicians to manually enter EPA reg numbers in the field from memory creates three failure modes. First, technicians don&apos;t remember 10-digit hyphenated numbers accurately. A reg number entered from memory as 62719-556 might be recorded as 62719-55 or 627195-56. Second, even if the number is looked up from the label, manual transcription introduces errors at high frequency. Third, some technicians skip the field entirely when they&apos;re moving fast and no one is watching.</p>
        <p>The only reliable way to capture EPA reg numbers in compliance logs is to not require technicians to enter them at all.</p>

        <h2>How the Product Library Eliminates Manual Entry</h2>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/weed-control-software">weed control software</a>, the product library stores each product&apos;s EPA registration number at setup time — entered once, by someone with time to verify it against the label. When a technician selects a product from the library in the field logging form, the EPA reg number pre-populates automatically from the stored product record. The technician never enters the number. They select the product; the system provides the reg number. No transcription errors. No skipped fields. No memory required.</p>
        <p>This approach also handles the occasional product change or reformulation. When a product is updated and receives a new EPA reg number, the product library entry is updated once — and all future applications that reference that product will include the correct updated number.</p>

        <h2>Other Required Fields in the Weed Control Compliance Log</h2>
        <p>Beyond the EPA reg number, a complete weed control compliance log should include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Date and time of application</li>
          <li>Property address and customer name</li>
          <li>Product name and EPA reg number</li>
          <li>Application rate per unit area (oz per 1,000 sq ft or oz per gallon)</li>
          <li>Total area treated (sq ft) by application zone (lawn, beds, shrubs)</li>
          <li>Total product used or gallons applied</li>
          <li>Weather conditions at time of application (temperature, wind speed, wind direction)</li>
          <li>Applicator name and license number</li>
          <li>Re-entry interval</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A structured field logging form with required fields and product library pre-fill captures all of these at the property before the technician leaves. The resulting records are complete, searchable, and producible on demand for any inspection.</p>
