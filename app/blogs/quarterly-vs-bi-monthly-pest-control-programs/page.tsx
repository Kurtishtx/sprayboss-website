        <h1>Quarterly vs. Bi-Monthly Pest Control: How to Manage Both Programs Without Mixing Up Due Dates</h1>

        <p>Quarterly pest control (4 visits per year, every 90 days) and bi-monthly pest control (6 visits per year, every 60 days) are the two most common recurring program structures in residential pest control. Many companies offer both — quarterly at a lower price point for lower-pressure pest situations and bi-monthly for customers with more active pest problems or higher service expectations. Running both simultaneously requires a scheduling system that tracks each program&apos;s interval independently and never surfaces a bi-monthly customer on a quarterly schedule or vice versa.</p>

        <h2>The Practical Difference in Scheduling Workload</h2>
        <p>A bi-monthly customer generates 50 percent more scheduling events per year than a quarterly customer. At 200 bi-monthly accounts, your system is scheduling 1,200 service events per year for that program alone. If every scheduling event for those 1,200 visits requires a manual action — rebooking, confirming, updating a calendar — you have 1,200 annual touchpoints consuming office time. If those scheduling events are automated, you have zero. The difference in administrative load between quarterly and bi-monthly programs is significant not because of the nature of the work but because of the scheduling frequency.</p>

        <h2>Due Date Accuracy Across Two Different Intervals</h2>
        <p>A quarterly customer completed on April 1st is due July 1st. A bi-monthly customer completed on April 1st is due June 1st. Both are in your waiting list. If your scheduling system doesn&apos;t independently track the interval for each program and calculate the next due date from the completion date, these two customers will surface at the wrong time — either too early (costing you product margin) or too late (annoying the customer and extending the gap between treatments). In purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-scheduling-software">pest control scheduling software</a>, interval tracking is automatic and independent per program. A quarterly account always auto-schedules 90 days out. A bi-monthly account always auto-schedules 60 days out. No manual calculation required.</p>

        <h2>Revenue Impact of Program Mix</h2>
        <p>The revenue difference between a quarterly and bi-monthly customer at the same per-visit price is 50 percent — bi-monthly generates 6 visits per year versus 4. If the average quarterly service is $95 and the average bi-monthly is $95 per visit, the annual revenue per account is $380 for quarterly and $570 for bi-monthly. For a company with 300 accounts, shifting 30 percent of the account base from quarterly to bi-monthly adds roughly $28,500 in annual recurring revenue without adding a single new customer. The waiting list revenue visibility by program type makes this shift trackable — you can see the quarterly vs. bi-monthly revenue breakdown at any time and measure the impact of program conversions.</p>

        <h2>Customer Communication by Program Type</h2>
        <p>Quarterly and bi-monthly customers should receive different scheduled service reminder texts. A quarterly customer receiving &quot;Your bi-monthly service is coming up&quot; is a small but real trust signal failure — it shows the company doesn&apos;t know what the customer signed up for. Configuring SMS templates by program type — &quot;Your quarterly pest control treatment is scheduled for...&quot; versus &quot;Your bi-monthly service is coming up on...&quot; — is a basic professional standard that also reduces cancellations by confirming to the customer that the scheduled service matches their program.</p>

        <h2>When a Customer Switches Programs Mid-Year</h2>
        <p>A quarterly customer who calls to upgrade to bi-monthly after experiencing increased pest activity should have their program interval updated in the system with the new interval taking effect from the current service forward. The next due date recalculates from the most recent completion date at the new 60-day interval. No scheduling rebuild required — the interval change propagates automatically from the point of update.</p>
