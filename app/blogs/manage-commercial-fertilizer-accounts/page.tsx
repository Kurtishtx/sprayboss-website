        <h1>How to Manage Multi-Property Commercial Fertilizer Accounts</h1>

        <p>Commercial fertilizer accounts — HOA communities, property management companies, commercial real estate portfolios — often involve a single client with multiple service addresses, each with its own square footage, program type, and scheduling needs. Managing these accounts requires a system that can hold multiple properties under one client record without conflating their individual service histories, programs, or compliance logs. Here&apos;s how to structure and manage them efficiently.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge of Multi-Property Commercial Accounts</h2>
        <p>A residential account is simple: one client, one property, one program. A commercial account might be a property management company with 12 HOA communities, each with three to five individual properties, all on different fertilizer programs because they have different turf types or were signed at different times of year. In a system designed for residential accounts, handling this requires either treating each property as a separate client (losing the organizational relationship) or putting all properties under one client record (making individual service history and invoicing a mess).</p>
        <p>The right structure is a client record that can hold multiple properties, each with their own independent service history, sq ft measurement, program assignment, and compliance log — all grouped under the client for billing and communication purposes.</p>

        <h2>Square Footage at the Property Level, Not the Account Level</h2>
        <p>In a multi-property commercial account, sq ft must be stored per property, not per client. Each location has a different turf area. Application rates, chemical volumes, and pricing all depend on the individual property&apos;s sq ft — not a combined total for the client. Storing sq ft at the client level produces incorrect calculations for every property that&apos;s not average in size.</p>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/fertilizer-software">fertilizer software</a>, each property profile stores its own sq ft, its own treatable turf area, its own notes, its own gate codes, and its own service history independently of every other property under the same client. The client record links to all of them for billing and communication, but the property data is property-level.</p>

        <h2>Independent Program Tracking Per Property</h2>
        <p>Different properties under the same commercial client may be on different fertilizer rounds at any given time. Property A might have had round three completed last week. Property B had a gate issue and skipped round three. Property C was added to the account mid-season and is starting from round one. All three need to be tracked independently in the waiting list.</p>
        <p>A system that tracks rounds at the property level (not the client level) handles this naturally. Each property shows its own round number in the waiting list, advances on its own schedule, and generates its own compliance log per visit. The commercial client sees a unified account view, but each property operates on its own timeline.</p>

        <h2>Invoicing Commercial Accounts: Per-Property or Combined</h2>
        <p>Commercial clients often prefer a single monthly invoice that covers all their properties, rather than individual invoices per property per visit. The billing system needs to be able to aggregate individual property services into a client-level invoice — showing each address, the service performed, the sq ft treated, and the per-visit charge — and produce a single total for the billing period.</p>
        <p>This is the commercial billing requirement that simple residential-focused tools can&apos;t handle: multiple properties, multiple visits, rolled into one professional invoice per billing cycle.</p>

        <h2>Compliance Logs for Commercial Accounts</h2>
        <p>Each property in a commercial account generates its own compliance logs, tied to the specific property address and service date. If the property management company is ever audited — or if a question arises about a specific address — you can pull the compliance record for that address independently without sorting through logs for every other property in the client&apos;s portfolio.</p>

        <h2>Routing Multi-Property Commercial Accounts</h2>
        <p>When a commercial client has multiple properties in the same geographic area, they can often be routed efficiently in one trip. A 12-unit HOA where three buildings need round four on the same day can be grouped in the same route by location and completed in sequence. The waiting list, filtered to show only that client&apos;s pending properties, makes this grouping visible — you can see all their due properties at once and pull them into a route together.</p>
