        <h1>How to Evaluate Pest Control Software — The Questions That Reveal Whether It&apos;s Built for This Industry</h1>

        <p>Evaluating pest control software requires asking questions that generic field service tool vendors can&apos;t answer well — not because their platform is bad, but because the questions reveal requirements that their architecture wasn&apos;t designed to meet. A vendor who can give fluent, specific answers to the questions below is selling a platform that understands recurring pest control operations. A vendor who deflects to features like &quot;fully customizable workflows&quot; or &quot;powerful reporting dashboards&quot; is selling a platform that doesn&apos;t natively support what you actually need to ask about. The questions that reveal the difference are specific.</p>

        <h2>Question 1: How Does the Next Treatment Schedule After I Complete One?</h2>
        <p>The answer you want: &quot;Automatically, from the completion date at the configured program interval. The account appears in the waiting list when the interval elapses without any action from your team.&quot; The answer that reveals a manual system: &quot;You can create a follow-up appointment from the completed job, or use a recurring job template.&quot; Auto-scheduling from completion date is non-negotiable for a pest control operation at scale. Manual rebooking after every treatment is the overhead you&apos;re trying to eliminate.</p>

        <h2>Question 2: How Does the Compliance Log Capture the EPA Registration Number?</h2>
        <p>The answer you want: &quot;From a product library. When the technician selects the product applied, the EPA reg number, active ingredient, and re-entry interval pre-fill automatically.&quot; The answer that reveals a gap: &quot;The technician enters it in a text field on the completion form.&quot; Manual EPA reg entry produces errors. Product library pre-fill eliminates them. This distinction matters in every compliance inspection.</p>

        <h2>Question 3: How Does the Re-Entry Interval Get Communicated to Customers?</h2>
        <p>The answer you want: &quot;The REI for the product applied is pulled from the product library record and included automatically in the post-service SMS when the technician submits the completion log.&quot; The answer that reveals a manual system: &quot;You can send a follow-up message after the job is complete.&quot; REI communication should be automatic and accurate to the specific product applied. A generic template with a fixed time window is not accurate REI communication.</p>

        <h2>Question 4: How Does the Platform Track Remaining Treatments in an Annual Contract?</h2>
        <p>If the vendor doesn&apos;t immediately know what you&apos;re asking about, the platform doesn&apos;t have package plan tracking. Purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-software">pest control software</a> tracks treatments remaining against the annual contract and surfaces accounts for renewal at the appropriate time. This is a fundamental feature of recurring program management. Its absence means manual renewal tracking in a spreadsheet alongside whatever the software does for scheduling.</p>

        <h2>Question 5: What Does the Pricing Look Like When I Add Technicians?</h2>
        <p>Per-user pricing that adds $30 to $50 per technician scales poorly. A company with 4 field technicians and 2 office users on a $45/user model is paying $270/month in user fees before any features are counted. Flat monthly pricing — all users, all features included — is the model that doesn&apos;t penalize hiring. Flat pricing at $129/month for all users and all features means the software cost stays constant as the business grows from 1 technician to 5.</p>

        <h2>Question 6: Can I Generate a Compliance Report for a State Inspection in Under a Minute?</h2>
        <p>The answer you want: &quot;Yes — open the chemical tracking report, enter the date range, click generate, print.&quot; The answer that reveals a limitation: &quot;You can export all records as a CSV and filter in Excel.&quot; Inspector-ready in under 60 seconds is the standard. A CSV export is a half-solution.</p>
