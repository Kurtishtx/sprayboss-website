        <h1>How to Manage Quarterly, Bi-Monthly, and Monthly Pest Control Programs in One System</h1>

        <p>Most pest control companies run multiple program types simultaneously — quarterly (4x/year), bi-monthly (6x/year), and monthly (12x/year) — often for different customer segments with different pest pressures and price points. Managing all three out of one scheduling system without mixing due dates, compliance logs, or SMS templates is the core operational challenge that separates companies running smoothly at 300+ recurring accounts from those still struggling at 80.</p>

        <h2>The Core Problem: Different Intervals, Same System</h2>
        <p>A quarterly customer is due every 90 days. A bi-monthly customer is due every 60 days. A monthly customer is due every 30 days. These are three separate scheduling cadences that must run independently, surface in the waiting list at the right time for each customer, and auto-reschedule at the correct interval after every completion. In a generic scheduling tool, this requires manually calculating and entering each next visit date after every completed stop. In purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-scheduling-software">pest control scheduling software</a>, each program type has a configured interval, and the system handles all three automatically without any office action between visits.</p>

        <h2>Waiting List Organization by Program Type</h2>
        <p>When all three program types are running simultaneously, the waiting list needs to clearly distinguish which accounts are due for which service frequency. A quarterly account due on July 15th and a monthly account due on July 15th are both on the waiting list on that date — but they require different products, different service durations, and different compliance log fields in many cases. Filtering the waiting list by program type lets the dispatcher pull quarterly-only accounts for one crew and monthly accounts for another without cross-referencing individual records.</p>
        <p>The sq ft total per program type in the waiting list also drives capacity planning. If you have 28 quarterly accounts at 168,000 sq ft and 42 monthly accounts at 310,000 sq ft due this week, those are two separate capacity calculations driving two separate crew assignments. Seeing them as a combined 70 stops doesn&apos;t tell you anything useful for planning; seeing them separated by program type tells you everything.</p>

        <h2>Compliance Log Fields by Program Type</h2>
        <p>Quarterly, bi-monthly, and monthly pest control programs often use different product mixes — a longer-residual product for quarterly exterior perimeter treatments, a shorter-residual product for monthly interior programs. Compliance log field requirements may also differ: an interior monthly program may need to log treatment areas (kitchen, bathroom, baseboards) that aren&apos;t relevant to an exterior quarterly perimeter. Configuring each program type with its own compliance log template ensures the right fields are captured for each service type without cluttering logs with irrelevant fields.</p>

        <h2>SMS Alert Templates by Program Type</h2>
        <p>A quarterly customer receiving their scheduled text should know it&apos;s their quarterly service. A monthly customer&apos;s scheduled notification should reference their monthly program. These aren&apos;t cosmetic differences — customers care about knowing what they&apos;re receiving and why. A generic &quot;your pest control service is scheduled&quot; message that doesn&apos;t reference the program type gets more cancellations because customers can&apos;t confirm it matches what they signed up for. Separate SMS templates per program type — &quot;Your quarterly exterior treatment is scheduled for...&quot; vs. &quot;Your monthly indoor pest control visit is scheduled for...&quot; — produce meaningfully better customer responses.</p>

        <h2>Revenue Visibility Across All Three Program Types</h2>
        <p>With multiple program types running simultaneously, total revenue visibility becomes a management tool. The waiting list shows not just which accounts are due but the expected revenue for each program type. A dispatcher who sees $2,400 in quarterly revenue due this week, $1,800 in bi-monthly revenue, and $3,200 in monthly revenue has an immediate picture of the week&apos;s financial output before routing begins. That number tracks against targets, informs crew allocation, and surfaces weeks where a program type is running light.</p>
