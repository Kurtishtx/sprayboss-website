        <h1>How to Schedule Mosquito Control Treatments at the Right Seasonal Intervals</h1>

        <p>Mosquito barrier spray programs live and die on interval precision. The typical residual window for a pyrethroid barrier spray is 21 days — which is also the standard treatment interval for most residential mosquito programs. Miss that window by a week and the customer has had 7 unprotected days during peak mosquito season. Miss it by two weeks and you have a customer calling to ask why they&apos;re getting bitten again. The scheduling challenge in mosquito control isn&apos;t knowing when to treat — it&apos;s making sure the system surfaces every customer at exactly the right time, across a full season of 5 to 7 treatments per customer, without anyone manually tracking individual due dates.</p>

        <h2>Why Mosquito Intervals Are Different From Other Recurring Programs</h2>
        <p>Most recurring chemical programs operate on 30-day, 60-day, or 90-day intervals — intervals long enough that a day or two of drift has minimal practical impact. A 21-day mosquito interval is significantly shorter and tighter. A customer treated on June 1st is due June 22nd. If they&apos;re not routed until June 28th, that&apos;s a 6-day gap from their optimal retreatment window — roughly 29 percent of the full treatment cycle. During active mosquito season in June and July, that gap is noticeable to the customer. The interval precision required for mosquito programs is higher than for any other common recurring service type.</p>

        <h2>How Auto-Scheduling Holds the 21-Day Interval</h2>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/mosquito-control-software">mosquito control software</a>, the treatment interval is configured at enrollment — 21 days for standard barrier spray, or custom intervals for specific product choices. When a technician marks a treatment complete and submits the compliance log, the system calculates the next due date as completion date + 21 days and creates a pending record for that date. When that date arrives, the account surfaces in the waiting list automatically. The interval is maintained from completion date — not from a fixed weekly schedule — so a treatment that runs a day late doesn&apos;t permanently shift the remaining schedule for the season.</p>

        <h2>Seasonal Program Structure: Start, Peak, and Close</h2>
        <p>A mosquito program typically runs April or May through September or October, depending on region. The first treatment of the season starts the 21-day cycle. Treatments 2 through 6 or 7 run on the auto-scheduled cycle. The final treatment closes the season. The scheduling system needs to support a defined season boundary — when fall arrives and the season ends, the system stops auto-scheduling for the winter rather than scheduling a December treatment. The following spring, accounts are re-enrolled for the new season, which resets the 21-day cycle from the first treatment date.</p>

        <h2>High-Volume Intervals During Peak Season</h2>
        <p>In June and July, all enrolled mosquito customers are active simultaneously — all cycling through 21-day intervals, all appearing in the waiting list at staggered intervals throughout peak months. A company with 200 mosquito accounts makes approximately 10 visits per business day through peak season, every business day, without significant volume variation. This predictable high-volume cadence is what makes routing efficiency and waiting list accuracy so critical during peak season: with 200 accounts all at or near their 21-day intervals, missing any of them creates immediate customer complaints about reduced protection.</p>

        <h2>Interval Flexibility for Different Products</h2>
        <p>Not all mosquito control products carry a 21-day residual. Some longer-residual products extend to 28 or 30 days. Some programs use a 14-day interval during peak season for maximum protection. The scheduling system should support custom interval configuration at the program level — not just a fixed 21-day default — so companies with diverse product lines or tiered program offerings can schedule each program type at its actual appropriate interval.</p>
