        <h1>How Mosquito Spray Software Handles Seasonal Program Start and Shutdown</h1>

        <p>Mosquito spray is a seasonal business in most markets — programs typically run April or May through September or October, with a spring startup and a fall close that are both operationally intensive. Spring startup means activating returning customer programs, communicating season start dates, building first-of-season routes, and dispatching first treatments across the full customer base within a compressed window. Fall close means completing last treatments, communicating season-end to customers, and setting programs to inactive until the following spring. Both transitions are points where accounts fall through the gaps in manual systems. Purpose-built <a href="/mosquito-spray-software">mosquito spray software</a> manages both transitions systematically.</p>

        <h2>Spring Startup: Activating Returning Programs</h2>
        <p>For returning customers, spring startup begins with re-activating their program from the previous season. The customer record, property, sq ft or linear ft measurements, product mixes, and pricing all carry over — no re-entry required. The first treatment of the new season is created in the waiting list when the season start date arrives. For companies with 200 returning customers, this activation can be processed in a batch rather than individually — setting the season start date in the package plan configuration and having all returning customer first treatments populate the waiting list automatically on the activation date.</p>

        <h2>First-of-Season Customer Communication</h2>
        <p>Season startup is the highest-engagement communication window in the mosquito spray calendar — customers are anticipating the service, outdoor activity is picking up, and the relevance of the message is at its peak. The automated alert system in mosquito spray software handles the season-start communication sequence: a season announcement message when the program is activated, the standard pre-service SMS when the first treatment is dispatched, and the post-service completion message with re-entry interval when the first treatment is completed. All three fire automatically from system events — no manual drafting or sending required.</p>

        <h2>Managing the In-Season Interval</h2>
        <p>Once the first treatment is complete, auto-scheduling takes over. Each treatment completion calculates the next due date at the configured program interval — typically 21 days for active mosquito season. The account surfaces in the waiting list when the interval elapses, regardless of what else is happening in the office. A technician who completes the third treatment on July 12th creates a Q4-equivalent due date of approximately August 2nd without anyone touching the schedule. The season runs itself between the startup action and the close action.</p>

        <h2>Fall Close: Completing Last Treatments and Deactivating Programs</h2>
        <p>At the end of the season, the final treatment for each customer is completed and logged. The program is then deactivated — either by setting an end date on the package plan or by clearing the remaining scheduled visits in the waiting list. Customers receive a season-close communication: &quot;Your last mosquito treatment of the season has been completed. We&apos;ll reach out in spring to activate your program for the new season.&quot; This close communication, sent automatically from the final completion, keeps the company in the customer&apos;s mind through the off-season and sets the expectation for renewal without a manual outreach effort months later.</p>
