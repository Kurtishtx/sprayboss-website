        <h1>How to Know Which Pest Control Customers Are Up for Renewal</h1>

        <p>The renewal window in pest control is narrow — and most companies miss it. The customer receives their final contracted treatment. The company doesn&apos;t have a system that flags the account as renewal-ready. Nobody makes the renewal call. Six weeks later, the customer receives a pest problem and calls a competitor. By the time the original company realizes they&apos;ve lost a recurring account, the customer is two treatments into a new annual plan somewhere else. This scenario plays out constantly in pest control businesses that track renewals manually — not because the salespeople are negligent, but because a spreadsheet of 200 contracts doesn&apos;t automatically surface which 20 of them are approaching renewal in the next 30 days. Purpose-built <a href="/pest-control-software">pest control software</a> does.</p>

        <h2>The Renewal Pipeline View</h2>
        <p>The renewal pipeline in pest control software is a filtered view of all active package plans sorted by treatments remaining. Accounts with 1 remaining treatment are the immediate renewal priority — these customers need to receive renewal outreach before their final treatment is dispatched, so the conversation happens while the program is still active. Accounts with 2 remaining treatments are the 30-day pipeline. Accounts with 3 remaining treatments are the 60-day horizon. This simple sort produces a prioritized renewal workload for the salesperson without any manual review of individual account records.</p>

        <h2>Renewal Outreach Timing</h2>
        <p>The ideal renewal conversation happens during the penultimate treatment visit — when the technician is on-site and the customer is home. The technician mentions that this is the second-to-last visit of their current plan and that renewal options will be coming their way. A few days later, the office sends a renewal estimate by email with one-click accept. This two-touchpoint approach — in-person mention followed by digital estimate — produces renewal rates significantly higher than a cold call made weeks after the final treatment when the customer may have already arranged alternative coverage.</p>

        <h2>Automated Renewal Estimate Sending</h2>
        <p>From the renewal pipeline view, the office can draft and send renewal estimates in bulk — select the accounts with 1 remaining treatment, generate renewal estimates from their previous year&apos;s package pricing, and send all estimates in a single batch action. Each estimate is personalized to the customer&apos;s specific program and pricing. Automated follow-up sequences fire if the estimate goes unaccepted after a defined number of days, keeping the renewal offer in front of the customer without requiring individual follow-up management.</p>

        <h2>What Happens When a Customer Accepts Renewal</h2>
        <p>When a renewal estimate is accepted, the package plan resets: the treatment counter returns to 0, the next treatment auto-schedules from the date of the final completed treatment plus the program interval, and the account continues in the recurring program without any manual setup. The customer&apos;s service history, property notes, product mixes, and compliance records all remain intact. Renewal is a one-click continuation, not a fresh setup.</p>
