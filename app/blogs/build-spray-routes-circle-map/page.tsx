        <h1>How to Build Spray Routes Using Circle Map Route Building</h1>

        <p>Building spray routes from a list of addresses has a fundamental problem: you&apos;re trying to construct a geographic sequence from text. Every address is a label, not a location. You&apos;re mentally mapping the stop sequence, grouping by ZIP code or neighborhood name, and hoping the sequence makes geographic sense when the tech actually drives it. Circle map routing solves this by making geography the starting point — you see where every due account is, draw a boundary around the area you want to work, and the route assembles from what&apos;s inside the circle. The geographic logic is built in from the first step.</p>

        <h2>How Circle Routing Works on the Waiting List Map</h2>
        <p>In purpose-built <a href="/spray-business-software">spray business software</a>, the waiting list has a map view that plots every due account as a pin — color-coded by service type and overdue status. You can see at a glance where demand is concentrated, which areas have overdue accounts, and which neighborhoods have a mix of service types. From this view, drawing a circle around any cluster of pins takes two seconds. The circle immediately returns a summary: total stops, total sq ft, expected revenue, service type breakdown, and overdue count. You know the scope of the route before you commit to a single stop.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Route Revenue Snapshot</h2>
        <p>The revenue snapshot before committing to a route is one of the most practically useful features in the circle routing workflow. If the circle contains 16 stops with $1,440 in expected revenue, and your historical daily target per truck is $1,600, you expand the circle slightly to capture two more stops. If the circle shows 22 stops with $2,100 in revenue at an estimated 9 hours of service time for a one-tech day, you shrink the circle or split the stops across two trucks. You make this decision before the route is built — from a number, not from a gut estimate of how long 22 stops will take.</p>

        <h2>Drive Order Optimization</h2>
        <p>After selecting stops inside the circle, route optimization calculates the most efficient drive sequence — minimizing total drive distance and time while maintaining practical start and end points. For spray routes where stops are geographically clustered and each stop takes 20 to 60 minutes on-site, drive order optimization produces meaningful daily time savings. A 20-stop spray route with even 8 percent better drive efficiency adds 30 to 45 minutes of additional service capacity per day.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Service-Type Routes</h2>
        <p>A spray business running multiple service types — fertilizer, weed control, pest control, mosquito — often has customers due for different services in the same geographic area on the same day. Circle routing surfaces all due accounts regardless of service type within the selected area. The dispatcher can build a mixed route for a technician certified in all programs, or filter to a single service type to build specialized routes. Either way, the geographic selection drives the decision — not manual cross-referencing of which accounts are due for which service.</p>

        <h2>Route Editing Before Dispatch</h2>
        <p>After the optimized route is generated, individual stops can be reordered, added, or removed before the route is dispatched. A stop that the dispatcher knows should come first (because the customer has a tight morning window) can be manually moved to position 1. A stop that was in the circle but is low-priority today can be deferred to tomorrow&apos;s route. These manual adjustments happen on top of the optimized base — you&apos;re fine-tuning a route that&apos;s already geographically logical, not building it stop by stop from scratch.</p>
